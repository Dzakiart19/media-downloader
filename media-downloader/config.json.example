DOCUMENTATION:
- download_path:

  '~' will be expanded to your home directory.
  On Termux, '~/storage/downloads' is a good choice for saving to your phone's public Downloads folder.

  Some useful ones:
  {title}: The full title of the video.

  {id}: The unique ID of the video (e.g., 'dQw4w9WgXcQ' for YouTube).

  {uploader}: The name of the uploader.
  {upload_date}: Date of upload in YYYYMMDD format.
  {ext}: The file extension (e.g., 'mp4', 'mp3'). This is added automatically.
